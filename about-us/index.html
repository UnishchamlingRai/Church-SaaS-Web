        <h1>How it all started</h1>
        <p>
          Our story began when our founder, Gavin, was on staff at his local
          church. Alongside his role as a kids' pastor, he built tools to help
          the church run more efficiently - the member's database, small group
          ministry and Gift Aid/giving to name a few. As other churches saw
          these tools, they showed an interest in using them, but they hadn't
          been built to be customisable or support multiple churches. In 2011,
          having pondered the idea for nearly 3 years, Gavin started to rebuild
          these tools from scratch and released a Beta product, ChurchApp, to a
          small number of churches in August of that year. With positive
          feedback and continued development, ChurchApp launched as a full
          product in January 2012, including four modules.

        <h1>Growing</h1>
        <p>
          Initial growth was encouraging and as our customer base grew (from 20
          (2012) to 250 (2015) to 1000 in 2018), so did our team. We're
          passionate about the local church and passionately support its
          mission. From developers to support team members, many of our team
          have previously been on staff at their local church, seeing first-hand
          how ChurchSuite can help in a ministry context. Today, ChurchSuite is
          trusted by more than 3,000 churches around the world. In 2017, we
          changed our name from ChurchApp to ChurchSuite. ChurchSuite is so much
          more than an app - it's a full suite of interconnected products,
          working seamlessly together, helping to organise and manage all
          aspects of church life.

      <div class="discription">
        <h1>Passionate about the local church</h1>
        <p>
          Despite all our well-loved and widely-used functionality, the feedback
          we consistently hear that ChurchSuite is best known for is its culture
          of passionate support for the local church and its mission. We love
          the Church and our mission is to build world-leading software that
          supports the Church at an affordable price. It is our passion and love
          for the Church that comes through in our customer service. Time and
          again, customers mention that they appreciate that we listen, respond
          promptly and take their feedback into account when building new
          features or updating existing ones. A growing number of customers have
          chosen to provide reviews, which are available online.

        <h1>This is just the beginning...</h1>
        <p>
          Over the years we've matured, grown and expanded... but our passion
          and energy remain the same! We have vision and dreams for new features
          and functionality, and we're so grateful to the churches who choose to
          join us on this journey. We might be a few years into this journey
          now, but our vision is the same it always has been: God has called us
          to build software that supports your church and extends His Kingdom.
          To us, this is just the beginning...
